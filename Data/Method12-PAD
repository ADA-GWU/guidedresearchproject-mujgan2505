PAD
Summary
General Tests of Emotion or Affect for Evaluating Consumer Reactions to Products and Services, Including User Interface.

Description
The PAD software averages responses of consumers to each stimulus and thus feedback on consumer emotional reactions to the stimuli being compared. Averages of the three basic pleasure (P), arousal (A), and dominance (D) values (scores) supplied by the software for each stimulus yield common-sense and meaningful data for evaluating and redesigning any stimulus.

Strengths
+ instrument has been well investigated;
â€˜+ used in different settings

Weaknesses
same drawbacks as with all subjective scales; the dominance scale is not always easy to understand for users.
