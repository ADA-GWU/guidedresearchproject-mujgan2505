Mental effort

Summary
Zijlstra’s mental effort scale is an easy and quick to use scale that helps to determine how much (perceived) mental effort was required to complete a task; depending on the setting, product and task, and in combination with other measures, this will help in getting a clearer picture of the overall quality of a product or service – too much mental effort will be stressful, and scary, too little mental effort will be boring….

Strengths

Weaknesses
needs to be used in combination with other tools to get a broader picture
