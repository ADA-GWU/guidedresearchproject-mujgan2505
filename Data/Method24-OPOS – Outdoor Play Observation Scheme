OPOS – Outdoor Play Observation Scheme
Summary
Method is used to evaluate children’s experience in outdoor pervasive gaming.

Description
While playing the game, video is recorded. Afterwards the video is analyzed for physical activity, social interaction and focus (what are the children looking at). These objective results can be combined with subjective opinions of children gathered during interviews.

Strengths
Objective measure of how much social interaction takes place. Doesn’t interfere during game play.

Weaknesses
Coding of videos is very time consuming.
