Weaknesses
Developed for a specific purpose â€” needs further development to be applicable to other work environments. To ensure that the results are reliable, a comparison between what users say in interviews and observations should be compared with questionnaire findings. Discrepancies should be checked with the users. Questionnaire in this form naturally answers to only the quesions that are asked in it, but may not capture what is relevant to users. This is why interviews are needed.
