Geneva Emotion Wheel
Summary
The Geneva Appraisal Questionnaire (GAQ) can be used to assess, as much as is possible through recall and verbal report, the results of an individual’s appraisal process in the case of a specific emotional episode (as based on Scherer’s Component Process Model of Emotion). The files available for download contain the current English, French, and German versions (and information on utilization).
This is a tool that can be used to describe emotional experiences (i.e. not a description as such). Tool is available in English, French and German

Strengths
developed by research group that is well-equipped to develop such scales

Weaknesses
