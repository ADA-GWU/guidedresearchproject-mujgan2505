Design and development of a board game that incorporates elements of tactical decision-making and strategic planning 


The design and development of a board game that incorporates elements of tactical decision-making and strategic planning is an exciting endeavor with great potential. This project aims to create a game that not only allows players to compete against each other but also provides the option to play against a challenging AI opponent. By analyzing different AI approaches, such as heuristics, tree-traversal algorithms like minimax and alpha-beta pruning, adversarial search algorithms, and other performance-enhancing techniques like memorization, the game can offer a captivating and dynamic experience. (Summary)
The game itself is a clever twist on the classic tic-tac-toe, introducing tactical and strategic elements. Players make their moves on a matrix-like board, where the chosen area determines where their opponent can play next. The decision process becomes increasingly challenging as players fill up their little tables and are forced to place their marks in other available slots. This unique mechanic adds depth and complexity to the game, requiring players to carefully plan their moves and anticipate their opponent's strategies.
Currently, board games are typically designed and developed using various techniques, such as game theory, heuristic algorithms, and machine learning. AI opponents in board games commonly rely on algorithms like minimax, alpha-beta pruning, or Monte Carlo Tree Search. However, this project aims to push the boundaries by researching innovative game mechanics and AI algorithms, combining insights from game design, AI, and decision-making algorithms.
The benefits of this work extend to both board game enthusiasts and researchers interested in AI. Board game enthusiasts can enjoy a challenging and engaging gameplay experience, whether playing against other players or testing their skills against a well-designed AI opponent. Researchers can gain insights into the application of advanced AI techniques, such as machine learning algorithms or neural networks, in the context of board games. This project could pave the way for further exploration of AI in game design and contribute to the broader field of artificial intelligence. (Strong Parts)
Like any project, there are potential risks to consider. Technical risks may arise from algorithmic complexity, scalability, and potential biases in AI decision-making. It will be essential to address these risks through rigorous testing, validation, and refining of the AI algorithms to ensure fair and balanced gameplay. (To be improved)
In terms of time and cost, completing this project within 11 weeks seems feasible. Considering the available tools, hardware limitations, and dataset collection, significant progress can be made in research, game design, and AI implementation. While achieving a fully polished product may be challenging within the given timeframe, a solid foundation and functional prototype can certainly be developed. (To be improved)
The midterm results would likely showcase significant progress in research, game design, and AI implementation. This includes the development of core game mechanics, initial AI prototypes, and conducting preliminary playtesting sessions to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. These milestones would demonstrate the project's feasibility and lay the groundwork for further development.
In the final demonstration, the fully developed board game and AI opponent would be showcased, highlighting the innovative mechanics, the AI's adaptability and competitiveness, and the overall enjoyment and engagement provided by the game. This demonstration would serve as a testament to the hard work and dedication put into designing and developing a captivating and immersive gaming experience.
Overall, this project holds great promise in terms of creating a board game that combines tactical decision-making and strategic planning with innovative AI algorithms. It has the potential to captivate players, push the boundaries of AI in gaming, and contribute to the advancement of both fields.
